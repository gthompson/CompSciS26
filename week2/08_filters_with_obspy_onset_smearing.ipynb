    "\n",
    "In seismology, filtering is usually described in terms of **which frequencies we keep** and **which we suppress**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three most common filter types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lowpass\n",
    "\n",
    "Passes **low frequencies**, attenuates high frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * removing high-frequency noise\n",
    "  * smoothing waveforms\n",
    "  * isolating long-period or very low-frequency signals\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* LP events\n",
    "* tilt-like or drift-dominated signals\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highpass\n",
    "\n",
    "Passes **high frequencies**, attenuates low frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * removing offsets, drift, and long-period trends\n",
    "  * emphasizing sharp arrivals (P, S, explosions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* picking P and S arrivals\n",
    "* suppressing instrument drift or temperature effects\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bandpass\n",
    "\n",
    "Passes a **restricted range** of frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * isolating the band where the **signal-to-noise ratio is highest**\n",
    "  * separating overlapping signal types\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* P-band vs S-band\n",
    "* LP-band vs tremor-band\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analog intuition vs digital practice\n",
    "\n",
    "In *analog* terms, we usually describe filters by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* frequency content\n",
    "* amplitude response\n",
    "* phase response\n",
    "\n",
    "But in *practice*, we implement filters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* digitally\n",
    "* on **sampled data**\n",
    "* using discrete-time algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "This has two important consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filters affect **amplitude and frequency**, as expected.\n",
    "2. Filters also affect **phase and timing** — sometimes in subtle ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Filtering does not only change *what frequencies* are present.\n",
    "> It can also change *when energy appears in time*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to a critical distinction between:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **one-way (causal)** filtering, and\n",
    "* **two-way (zero-phase)** filtering.\n",
    "\n",

    "The parameter `corners` controls the **steepness** of the filter’s frequency response:\n",

    "\n",
    "A one-way (causal) filter has an **asymmetric impulse response in time**:\n",
    "it only depends on past samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A zero-phase filter is constructed by:\n",

    "1. applying the filter forward in time, and then\n",

    "* convolved with its **time-reversed version**\n",
    "\n",
    "ObsPy does this automatically when `zerophase=True`.\n",

    "* timing of features can change\n",
    "\n",
    "Some distortions are acceptable or even useful.\n",

    "  * onsets can be slightly smeared\n",

    "* **Two-way (zero-phase) filters** avoid any *net* phase delay\n",
    "\n",
    "  * the waveform is not shifted later overall\n",
    "  * but they can produce **symmetric ringing** around sharp features\n",
